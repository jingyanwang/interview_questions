Inside the data folder, there is a csv containing the CAISO LMP prices for September (source). The goal of this exercise is to complete the following methods for some simple data manipulation:

calculate_total_price_per_timestamp: Calculate the total price per unique timestamp and return a pandas Series with the values equaling the total price.
find_date_with_highest_prices: Return the datetime that has the highest total price (should sum across all timestamps within that date).
*Note: There are hidden tests on this assignment, so passing the visible tests does not guarantee a perfect score.

[execution time limit] 30 seconds
